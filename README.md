# 💬 NL2SQL Diskominfo Sleman

This project bridges the gap between non-technical users and complex database queries. It enables users to interact with administrative databases of Sleman Regency using natural language (in Indonesian or local dialects), translating their questions into accurate SQL queries while maintaining context-awareness and precision.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Executed SQL Results**: Instead of returning raw SQL syntax, the system executes the generated query and displays the final results. This makes it easier for users to directly get the information they need, without dealing with technical query statements.
- **Natural Language Interface**: Ask questions like *"How many residents live in Godean District?"* and get direct answers from the database.
- **Local Language Support**: Understands questions in both standard Indonesian and local Sleman dialects.
- **LLM-Powered SQL Generation**: Uses large language models (LLMs) to translate natural language into accurate SQL queries.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easily customize the app via JSON files for database metadata and model settings.
